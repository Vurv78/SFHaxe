# SFHaxe
Proof of concept Haxe Library for the lua target that adds StarfallEx bindings.  
This was autogenerated by a lua script I made.  
Hopefully will have the script in this repo as well, made in Haxe.  

## Features:
* Bindings for every Library and Type in StarfallEx.
* Bindings are autogenerated, so it can be updated incredibly easily.
* ...?

## Todos:
* Publish the autogeneration script
* Rewrite the autogeneration script in Haxe (maybe)
* Recognize metamethods and turn them into haxe metamethods.
* Add a standard library that assists with the stuff that can't be autogenerated (Std.print uses io which starfall doesn't have.)

## How to use:
Just make a Haxe project, put this into your src folder or whatever, and use it as ``Example.hx`` does.

## What would you use this for?
* If you wanted to have typed, (maybe neater) code.
* If you don't want your source code to be stolen, this works as well since it transpiles into lua.
* If you like the syntax of Haxe, which is a JS-like language.
* If you want the power of macros, actual classes, abstract classes and more thanks to Haxe.
