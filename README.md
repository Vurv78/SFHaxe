[Haxe](https://haxe.org) library that adds [StarfallEx](https://github.com/thegrb93/StarfallEx) bindings that are autogenerated in the [generator](https://github.com/Vurv78/SFHaxe/tree/generator) branch.  

Write Starfall scripts in the same typed, null safe and powerful language that many popular [programs](https://haxe.org/use-cases/desktop) & [games](https://haxe.org/use-cases/games) like [*Friday Night Funkin'*](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) are written in.

## What is Haxe?
_See [what is haxe?](https://haxe.org/manual/introduction-what-is-haxe.html), and a [code sample](https://try.haxe.org/embed/44ddE#code1) here._  
Long story short, it's a language that compiles to other languages while adding a lot of neat features to extend them.

<details>
  <summary> Check out some of these features here. </summary>
  
  * [Macros](https://haxe.org/manual/macro-arguments.html)
  * [Regex / Pattern Matching](https://lib.haxe.org/p/hre) <!-- Putting a link to hre instead of Haxe's native Regex because it requires a module for lua. -->
  * [Null Safety](https://haxe.org/manual/cr-null-safety.html)
  * [Map Comprehension](https://haxe.org/manual/lf-map-comprehension.html)
  * [Conditional Compilation](https://haxe.org/manual/lf-condition-compilation.html)
  * [Object Oriented Classes](https://haxe.org/manual/types-class-instance.html)
  * [String Interpolation](https://haxe.org/manual/lf-string-interpolation.html)
  * [Abstract Types](https://haxe.org/manual/types-abstract.html)
  * [Runtime Reflection](https://haxe.org/manual/std-reflection.html)
  * [Powerful IDE Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nadako.vshaxe) <!-- There is also IntelliJ, Vim, Atom and Sublime support. (Probably more too) -->
  * [Much more](https://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/language-features.html)
</details>

## Features:
* Autogenerated bindings for every Library and Type in StarfallEx.
* IDE Documentation so you don't have to get out of your editor to find out what a function does.
* Some support for replacing Haxe standard library with sf friendly methods.

## What would you use this for?
* If you want typed, more powerful & easier to manage code.
* If you don't want your source code to be stolen, this works as well since the source is transpiled into unrecognizable lua.
* If you wanted to use all of Haxe's public libraries (see lib.haxe.org), which a good portion should be compatible with SFHaxe.

## Installing
* [Get Haxe](https://haxe.org) (Version must be > 4.2.0)
* Install using Haxe's package manager haxelib: ``haxelib install sfhaxe``
* That's it!

## Using SFHaxe
_Look at [examples/Basic Full](https://github.com/Vurv78/SFHaxe/tree/main/examples/Basic%20Full) for a full example._

Make a Haxe project, and in your ``build.hxml`` file add:  
```hxml
# Optional: Delete Unused Code
--dce full

# Link to sfhaxe.
--library sfhaxe

# Example Defines
--define SERVER # Can be SERVER, CLIENT or SHARED
--define NAME=A cool chip
--define SUPERUSER
--define AUTHOR=Vurv
--define MODEL=a/model/path.mdl

# Set the Haxe path to the current directory of the hxml + /src/
--class-path src

# Tell the compiler to generate lua code at this path local to %CD%
--lua bin/outscript.lua

# Set the main class to compile from. In this case, you have a file called Main.hx in /src/ that creates class Main.
--main Main
```

_If you want Haxe bindings for GLua to make addons instead of Starfall scripts, check out [gmodhaxe](https://github.com/ponobodod/gmodhaxe). (Not made by me so can't confirm how good it is)_
